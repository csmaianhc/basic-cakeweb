            <p>If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the right to object to processing based solely on automated decision-making <br>(which includes profiling), when that decision-making has a legal effect on you or otherwise significantly affects you.</br>

                Services that include elements of automated decision-making include:</p>

            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>A cookie is a small amount of information that’s downloaded to your computer or device when you visit our Site. <br>We use a number of different cookies, including functional, performance, advertising, and social media or content cookies. </br>Cookies make your browsing experience better by allowing the website to remember your actions and preferences <br>(such as login and region selection). This means you don’t have to re-enter this information each time you return to the </br> site or browse from one page to another. Cookies also provide information on how people use the website, for instance <br> whether it’s their first time visiting or if they are a frequent visitor.

                We use the following cookies to optimize your <br> experience on our Site and to provide our services.
                
                The length of time that a cookie remains on your computer or mobile <br>device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies last until you stop browsing and </br>persistent cookies last until they expire or are deleted. Most of the cookies we use are persistent and will expire between <br> 30 minutes and two years from the date they are downloaded to your device.
                
                You can control and manage cookies in <br>various ways. Please keep in mind that removing or blocking cookies can negatively impact your user experience and <br>parts of our website may no longer be fully accessible.
                
                Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can choose <br> whether or not to accept cookies through your browser controls, often found in your browser’s “Tools” or “Preferences” <br>menu. Additionally, please note that blocking cookies may not completely prevent how we share information with third <br> parties such as our advertising partners. To exercise your rights or opt-out of certain uses of your information by these <br>parties, please follow the instructions in the “Behavioural Advertising” section above.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
            <h3>Do Not Track </h3>
            <p>Please note that because there is no consistent industry understanding of how to respond to “Do Not Track” signals,<br> we do not alter our data collection and usage practices when we detect such a signal from your browser.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="entry">
            <h3>Changes </h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for <br>other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.></p>

        <h1>Delivery</h1>

        <div class="entry">
            <p> We create elegant, delectable celebration cakes by hand, which, by their very nature, are delicate and require <br>the utmost care. All of our baked goods are packaged carefully, and you are welcome to pick them up from<br> our Oxford store. </p>
            <p>We offer delivery for a fee within a 50-mile radius of our shops in our own Cake Shop vans by our dedicated <br>drivers in order to ensure that your cake arrives safely. For our more elaborate custom cakes and wedding cakes, <br>we will travel further afield, including London; therefore, please contact us so that we can calculate the delivery fee. </p>
            <p>As many of our cakes are too delicate to be couriered, we charge a delivery fee to cover the cost of fuel, van <br> maintenance, and driver labour.</p>

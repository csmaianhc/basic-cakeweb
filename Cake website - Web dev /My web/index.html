            <h1> our story  </h1>
            <p class="text"> The term "Party Bakeries" can be traced back to culinary festivals 
                <br> that celebrated cakes in the middle of Seoul. These festivals gave </br>
                 rise to the concept. We intend to bring about and alter changes in 
                <br> the way that people eat, drink, and unwind in their free time. We </br>
                quickly expanded and established a presence in some of the most 
                <br> important nations in the world after the success of a series of </br>
                traditional and modern cakes in Korea, such as Maejakgwa, Jeung-
                <br>pyeon,and Hobaktteok. Other countries where we have a presence </br>
                includes Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, and other countries.
                <br> We create the ideal combination of scrumptiousness and sweetness </br>
                of Korean culture while keeping concept of local regeneration in mind 
                <br>After opening our first store <span class="dots"></span><span class="more-text"> in Seoul more than twenty years ago </br>
                we are making preparations for the opening of our 26th store and are 
                <br> working on additional exciting plans at the same time. Let's go to </br>
                "Party Bakeries" and enjoy some of their delicious baked goods. We 
                <br> guarantee that you will not be dissatisfied in any way. </br>
